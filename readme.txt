What scene you attempted to create (i.e., what experience were you trying to accomplish)
3D Text rotates about a party sphere, and as we move the mouse, the camera moves, which enables
us to look at it from different perspectives.

What geometries you created
A rotating text, which says CU Boulder
and a sphere at the center, about which the text rotates
Both models are created in TinkerCAD and loaded into three.js

Any textures, materials, or shaders you created
Metallic material for the sphere inside and custom shader for the text.

Any outside resources used (e.g., models from the 3D warehouse, textures found online, etc.)
